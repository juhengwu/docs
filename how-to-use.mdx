This page outlines practical workflows for teams using Know Your AI day-to-day.

## 1) Set up your workspace

Start by creating a workspace and inviting your team.

- Name it after your product or project
- Assign roles: **owner** for the lead, **admin** for managers, **developer** for engineers, **viewer** for stakeholders
- Check your quota allocation in **Usage & Limit**

## 2) Create and connect products

Add each AI system you want to evaluate as a product.

- **Website products**: Enter the URL. Browser-Use will auto-detect input/response selectors using Gemini Vision. You can watch evaluations live via VNC.
- **API products**: Enter your endpoint URL and authentication token. Supports OpenAI-compatible and custom APIs.
- **Streaming API products**: Configure for streaming response endpoints.

Follow the **onboarding roadmap** on each product page: Select Datasets → Connect API → Start Test → Complete.

## 3) Build your dataset library

Use a mix of sources:

- Browse the **Dataset Marketplace** for community and system-curated attack prompts
- Upload custom datasets (JSON/CSV) in **Workspace Datasets** with input, golden answer, and knowledge fields
- Cover the key attack categories: jailbreak, prompt injection, data extraction, harmful content, PII leakage, bias, hallucination

## 4) Run security evaluations

Compose and execute evaluation runs.

- Go to **Compose Evaluation** and select your datasets
- Configure the prompt count (or use random sampling)
- Start the run and watch the **real-time console** for streaming execution logs
- For website products, use the **VNC viewer** for live browser observation

## 5) Review results

Each evaluation run produces:

- **Security score** with vulnerability percentage
- **Per-prompt pass/fail** with judge analysis explaining each decision
- **Compliance report** with CCPA/CPRA violation analysis
- **Screenshots** captured during browser automation (website products)
- **Execution logs** with prompt, response, and judgment details

## 6) Set up scheduled evaluations

Automate recurring security testing:

- Go to **Scheduled Tasks** in your product sidebar
- Configure schedules: hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or custom cron
- Enable/disable schedules as needed
- Track scheduled run results in **Test History**

## 7) Integrate SDK monitoring

Deploy the `@know-your-ai` SDK to monitor your AI system in production:

- Install the SDK and configure your **DSN** from product settings
- Monitor in the **Monitoring Dashboard**: requests, tokens, cost, latency, errors
- Debug issues in the **Tracing** view with span-tree visualization
- Track token usage trends over time

## 8) Enable the firewall

Add real-time protection with the firewall:

- Generate a **Firewall API key** in your product's Firewall settings
- Integrate the firewall SDK into your application
- Monitor validations in **Firewall Logs** with risk categorization
- Track token usage in **Firewall Token Usage**

## 9) Track compliance

Stay on top of regulatory requirements:

- Review the **Compliance** dashboard for aggregated violation counts
- Explore per-run compliance reports with evidence
- Track CCPA/CPRA, EU AI Act, and NIST AI RMF coverage
- Use the **Security Report** for baseline vs. firewall comparisons

## Product sidebar reference
