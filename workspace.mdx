description: "How workspaces organize projects, people, and environments."

A workspace is the top-level boundary in Know Your AI. It groups products, datasets, evaluations, and monitoring views for a single project or team.

## What belongs in a workspace

- One or more AI products (Website, API, or Streaming API)
- Shared datasets and evaluation configurations
- Team members with role-based access controls
- Quota allocation and usage tracking

## Workspace tiers

Workspaces are organized by tier, which determines available features and quotas.

| Tier | Features |
| --- | --- |
| Free | Basic evaluation runs, limited quota |
| Pro | Extended quota, access to Pro datasets, advanced features |
| Enterprise | Custom limits, priority support, full compliance reporting |

## Roles and permissions

Each workspace member has one of four roles:

| Role | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| **Owner** | Full access including delete workspace, manage billing |
| **Admin** | Manage members, products, all operations except delete workspace |
| **Developer** | Run evaluations, compose tests, operate within products |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access (view test history, tracing, overview — no operations) |

## Invitations

Invite team members by email with a specific role. Invitations can be:

- **Pending** — Waiting for the recipient to respond
- **Accepted** — Member has joined the workspace
- **Declined** — Recipient declined the invitation
- **Expired** — Invitation was not accepted in time

## Usage and quotas

Each workspace has a quota allocation that resets monthly. Track usage in the **Usage & Limit** page:

- Total allowed evaluation runs per month
- Current usage with reset date
- Usage ledger showing per-run deductions

## Workspace setup checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name and scope the workspace">
    Match the scope to a product or team so results are actionable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite the right people">
    Add product, ML, security, and compliance stakeholders. Assign roles appropriately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first product">
    Add a product (Website, API, or Streaming API) and follow the onboarding roadmap.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add datasets">
    Browse the Dataset Marketplace or upload your own datasets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices

- Keep one workspace per product line or team to avoid mixing metrics
- Use the quota dashboard to monitor evaluation run usage
- Assign the minimum role needed — use Viewer for stakeholders who only need read access
