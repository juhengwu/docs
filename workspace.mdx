A workspace is the top-level boundary in Know Your AI. It groups datasets, evaluations, and monitoring views for a single product or project.

## What belongs in a workspace

- One AI product or feature area
- Shared datasets and evaluation logic
- Team members and access controls
- Environment-specific settings

## Environments

Use environments to prevent accidental production changes and keep results clear.

| Environment | Typical use |
| --- | --- |
| Dev | Early experiments and rubric drafts |
| Staging | Release candidates and pre-prod validation |
| Prod | Live monitoring and compliance reporting |

## Roles and permissions

Common workspace roles include:

- **Admin**: manage settings, members, and permissions
- **Editor**: create and run evaluations
- **Reviewer**: annotate results, approve releases
- **Viewer**: read-only access for stakeholders

## Workspace setup checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name and scope the workspace">
    Match the scope to a product or AI feature so results are actionable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite the right people">
    Include product, ML, QA, and compliance stakeholders early.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define environments">
    Configure dev/staging/prod to align with your release flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a baseline dataset">
    Use a representative dataset to anchor future comparisons.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices

- Keep one workspace per product line to avoid mixing metrics
- Store baseline evaluations before any major model change
- Document ownership for each evaluation and dashboard
