Monitoring gives you full visibility into your production AI system. Integrate the `@know-your-ai` SDK to automatically capture every AI interaction and surface it in dashboards and traces.

## SDK integration

Add the `@know-your-ai` SDK to your application to start capturing events.

1. Install the SDK package
2. Configure your **DSN** (Data Source Name) from the product settings
3. The SDK automatically captures: provider, model, token usage, cost, latency, errors, and trace/span data

## Monitoring dashboard

The monitoring dashboard aggregates SDK events with key metrics:

- **Total requests** — Count of AI interactions over time
- **Error count** — Failed requests and error rates
- **Average duration** — Response time metrics
- **Token usage** — Input, output, and cached tokens
- **Cost tracking** — Estimated cost per interaction
- **Latency breakdown** — TTFB, throughput, p95 percentiles
- **Provider distribution** — Usage split by AI provider
- **Model distribution** — Usage split by model version

## Tracing

The tracing view provides a full span-tree visualization for debugging AI interactions.

**Supported span types:**

| Span type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Generation | LLM call with input/output |
| Agent | Agent orchestration step |
| Tool | Tool/function call |
| Chain | Chained processing step |
| Retriever | RAG retrieval step |
| Evaluator | Evaluation judgment |
| Guardrail | Safety/content filter |
| Event | Custom event |

Each span includes:

- Trace, session, and user context
- Input/output data
- Tool calls and errors
- Duration and timing
- Filterable by status, model, and time range

## Token usage charts

Track token usage over time with configurable views:

- Input tokens, output tokens, and total
- Configurable granularity: hour, day, month
- Time ranges: 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days
- Server response time charts
