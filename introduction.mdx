Know Your AI is a security, evaluation, and monitoring platform built to help teams understand, test, and protect AI systems end-to-end.
It combines attack-driven datasets, automated LLM judging, compliance analysis, SDK-based monitoring, and a firewall —
all in one place — so teams can ship with confidence.

This site contains the product overview, quickstart guides, and feature documentation to get your team up and running.

## What is Know Your AI?

Know Your AI is an evaluation, monitoring, and compliance platform for AI applications. It centralizes:

- **Workspaces** for organizing teams, products, and access controls
- **Products** representing the AI systems you evaluate (Website, API, or Streaming API)
- **Datasets** from the Marketplace and your own uploads — covering attack prompts, safety tests, and benchmarks
- **Evaluations** with configurable LLM-as-Judge scoring and automated compliance analysis
- **Monitoring** with SDK-based dashboards for requests, tokens, latency, cost, and errors
- **Tracing** with span-tree visualization for debugging AI interactions
- **Firewall** for real-time input/output validation with risk categorization
- **Compliance** dashboards for CCPA/CPRA violation tracking with evidence trails

## Who is it for?

- **Product teams** validating new model releases and prompt changes
- **ML/AI engineers** red-teaming models with attack datasets
- **Security teams** testing for jailbreaks, prompt injection, and data extraction
- **Risk & compliance** teams tracking CCPA/CPRA, EU AI Act, and NIST AI RMF policies
- **Engineering teams** monitoring production AI with SDK integration
