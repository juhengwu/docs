## 1) Create a workspace

Workspaces keep data, evaluations, and access controls isolated by project.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name the workspace">
    Choose a clear project name like “Customer Support Copilot”.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add members">
    Invite teammates and assign roles (admin, editor, reviewer, viewer).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2) Connect your product

Choose a dataset from the Prompt Market and connect it to your product.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick a dataset">
    In **Product**, choose a dataset from the Prompt Market. These include community attack prompts,
    attack methods, and benchmarks such as Humanity’s Last Exam.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your API">
    Link your product endpoint so we can run the dataset against your model for offline evaluation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the connection">
    Save the product connection so the evaluation can run with the selected dataset.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3) Run your first evaluation

Run the dataset through your product and score the results.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a judge">
    Use **LLM as the Judge**, **Human Annotate**, or both.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the evaluation">
    Start the offline evaluation to collect model responses and scores.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review issues and risks">
    We analyze the responses and surface the key problems and risks found in the run.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4) Share results

Use the evaluation report to align on improvements and next steps.

- Review the scored examples and annotations
- Track the risks that matter to your product
- Export findings for your team
