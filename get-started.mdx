This guide walks through creating a workspace, uploading a dataset, and running an evaluation.

## 1) Create a workspace

Name the workspace, add team members, and set environments (dev/staging/prod).

## 2) Add a dataset

Upload a CSV or connect your application logs. Map fields: prompt, response, metadata, ground truth.

## 3) Build and run an evaluation

Create a rubric, choose a scorer (automated, LLM-judge, or human), set thresholds, and run the evaluation.
