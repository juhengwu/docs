Know Your AI provides automated compliance analysis for every evaluation run, with persistent evidence storage
and regulatory coverage reporting.

## CCPA/CPRA compliance analysis

Every evaluation run automatically analyzes AI responses for CCPA/CPRA compliance violations.

### Three-tier analysis

Violations are classified into three tiers based on regulatory relevance:

| Tier | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | Direct relevance | Responses that directly handle personal data or privacy requests |
| Tier 2 | Indirect relevance | Responses that indirectly impact data privacy practices |
| Tier 3 | Ancillary relevance | Responses with peripheral privacy implications |

### Severity levels

Each violation is assigned a severity level:

- **None** — No compliance concern
- **Low** — Minor issue, informational
- **Medium** — Moderate concern requiring review
- **High** — Significant violation requiring action
- **Critical** — Severe violation requiring immediate remediation

### Per-prompt evidence

For each flagged response, the system records:

- The violating text snippet
- Category of the violation
- Detailed analysis explaining the issue
- Legal reference citing the relevant regulation
- Full prompt and response pair

## Regulatory coverage

The compliance dashboard covers multiple regulatory frameworks:

| Framework | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| **CCPA/CPRA** | Per-run violation analysis with 3-tier scoring |
| **EU AI Act** | Regulatory alignment assessment |
| **NIST AI RMF** | Risk management framework evaluation |

The **Security Report** provides a side-by-side comparison showing baseline results vs. firewall-protected results,
helping teams quantify the impact of safety measures.

## Compliance dashboard

Each product has a dedicated **Compliance** page that aggregates:

- Total violation counts by tier and severity
- Regulation-level breakdown summaries
- Dataset-level risk summaries
- Per-run compliance reports with evidence explorer

## Compliance evidence store

All compliance findings are persistently stored as **ComplianceEvidence** records, including:

- Full prompt and response text
- Violation category, tier, and severity
- Legal analysis and regulatory references
- Linked to specific evaluation runs for traceability

## Workflow

1. Run an evaluation with attack or compliance datasets.
2. The system automatically judges each response for CCPA/CPRA compliance.
3. View the **Compliance Report** for the run with per-category violation breakdown.
4. Explore individual violations in the evidence panel.
5. Track trends across runs in the product **Compliance** dashboard.
6. Export findings for legal, security, and leadership reviews.
