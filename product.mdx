Know Your AI is a platform for evaluating, monitoring, and governing AI systems from prototype to production.
It combines attack-driven datasets, LLM-as-Judge evaluation, SDK-based monitoring, and a firewall in one place so teams can ship with confidence.

## Platform modules

| Module | What it does | Typical users |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Products | Represent AI systems (Website, API, Streaming API) with onboarding, connections, and metrics | Product, ML engineers |
| Datasets | Store attack prompts, safety tests, benchmarks — from the Marketplace or uploaded by your team | ML engineers, security |
| Evaluations | Score security, safety, and compliance with configurable LLM-as-Judge and automated analysis | Product, ML, security |
| Monitoring | Track live SDK events — requests, tokens, cost, latency, errors — with dashboards | ML ops, engineering |
| Tracing | Visualize AI interaction spans (generation, agent, tool, chain, retriever, guardrail) in a tree view | ML engineers, debugging |
| Firewall | Validate inputs/outputs in real time with risk categorization and token tracking | Security, engineering |
| Compliance | CCPA/CPRA violation tracking with 3-tier analysis, EU AI Act, and NIST AI RMF coverage | Risk, compliance, legal |

## Product types

When you create a product, choose the type that matches your AI system:

| Type | Description | Evaluation method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Website | Web-based chatbot or AI UI | Browser automation with Brave + VNC live viewer |
| API | Standard REST API endpoint | Direct API calls (OpenAI-compatible or custom) |
| Streaming API | Streaming API endpoint | Streaming API calls |

## Data flow

1. **Create** a product and connect your AI system endpoint.
2. **Select** datasets from the Marketplace or upload your own.
3. **Evaluate** by composing tests that send prompts and judge responses with an LLM.
4. **Analyze** security scores, per-prompt pass/fail, and compliance violations.
5. **Monitor** ongoing health with SDK integration, dashboards, and tracing.

## What problems it solves

- **Security vulnerabilities** from jailbreaks, prompt injection, and data extraction attacks
- **Safety risk** from harmful, biased, or policy-violating outputs
- **Compliance gaps** in CCPA/CPRA, EU AI Act, and NIST AI RMF policies
- **Lack of visibility** into production AI usage, cost, and errors
- **Quality regression** after model or prompt changes

## Built-in capabilities

- 15+ attack methods (GCG, ABJ, PAIR, DAN, CIPHER, and more)
- LLM-as-Judge with configurable models and prompts
- Browser automation with VNC for website products
- Real-time execution console with streaming logs
- SDK integration for production monitoring and tracing
- Firewall with input/output validation and token tracking
- CCPA/CPRA compliance analysis with 3-tier violation scoring
- Scheduled evaluations (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, custom cron)
- Workspace quota management with usage ledger
- Dataset and Evaluation Marketplaces

## Security and governance

Know Your AI is designed for teams that need traceability and access controls:

- Role-based access per workspace (owner, admin, developer, viewer)
- Workspace-level isolation for products, datasets, and evaluations
- Audit-ready evaluation history with per-run evidence
- Quota system with monthly reset and usage ledger
- Workspace tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise)
