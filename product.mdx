Know Your AI is a platform for evaluating, monitoring, and governing AI systems from prototype to production.
It combines data capture, evaluation logic, and observability in one place so teams can ship with confidence.

## Platform modules

| Module | What it does | Typical users |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Datasets | Store prompts, responses, metadata, and ground truth | ML engineers, QA |
| Evaluations | Score quality, safety, policy alignment, and regression risk | Product, ML, risk |
| Monitoring | Track live performance and detect drift | ML ops, engineering |
| Evidence | Keep audit trails for decisions and releases | Compliance, leadership |
| Collaboration | Reviews, comments, and approval workflows | Cross-functional teams |

## Data flow

1. **Capture** interactions from logs, tests, or manual uploads.
2. **Normalize** fields into datasets with consistent schemas.
3. **Evaluate** with automated metrics, LLM-judge rubrics, or humans.
4. **Monitor** ongoing health with dashboards and alerts.
5. **Report** outcomes with clear evidence for stakeholders.

## What problems it solves

- **Quality regression** after model or prompt changes
- **Safety risk** from harmful or policy-violating outputs
- **Drift** as user behavior or data changes over time
- **Lack of evidence** for audits or leadership reviews

## Built-in capabilities

- Versioned datasets and evaluation runs
- Multi-model comparisons and baselines
- Policy and safety checks
- Human review queues
- Automated alerts and reporting

## Security and governance

Know Your AI is designed for teams that need traceability and access controls:

- Role-based access per workspace
- Environment isolation (dev/staging/prod)
- Audit-ready evaluation history
- Optional data retention policies
